# La Grassa Italian Restaurant Stop Gap Website
This is a showcase of a simple wordpress [stop gap website](https://onlinemexicancom.wpcomstaging.com/) I built for [La Grassa Pastificio](https://lagrassaitaliano.com/) 
while they were waiting on a larger marketing firm to complete their multi month design / media collection process. 

## Project Description and Reflection
This page was created to be a **Temporary** solution to address this small business' problem. 

At the time I was asked to help, the restaurant had an existing basic html site with few photos and no existing links to their reservation system. 

They had an existing agreement with a larger marketing firm, 
but the new web page they were creating for them was going to take multiple months 
and included a multiple photo shoots and social media management. 

In the mean time I created and helped them deploy a website that met their business needs using wordpress. You can view a backup of the site [here](https://onlinemexicancom.wpcomstaging.com/)
